## Abstract
The aim of this project to collect and document information about Zeblaze Thor Ultra 4G smartwatch. Getting `adb` access, backing up the ROM, maybe even custom ROMs or custom apps.

Overall my aim is for a smartwatch to fully replace my phone and provide the bare essentials I need.

## Initial findings
- SoC used is [Unisoc 8541E](https://www.unisoc.com/en_us/home/con545-8541E-1) (also known as Spreadtrum SC8541E)
- Connects via USB as Spreadtrum Phone `idVendor=1782, idProduct=4011, bcdDevice= 4.04` 
- Possible way to get `adb` [via XDA forums](https://xdaforums.com/t/generic-sl8541e-sc8541e-information-about-generic-chinese-smartwatches-with-the-spreadtrum-unisoc-soc.4654255/post-89358195) (have not tested yet myself)

## What do I think about the watch?
### What I like
- Provided charger cable includes data lines
- Screen looks rather good and touch is quite responsive
- Full keybaord is totally usable!
- WiFi hotspot works and works very well
- Battery lasts 72h+ with light usage (few calls, few messages, short bursts of hotspotting)

### What I do not like
- 4G reception is poor
- Band is a bit stiff and sometimes irritates the skin, but waiting for some Aliexpress options

### What I am unsure about?
- Does it have bloatware? And security issues?
- Would like to explore running processes and reduce bloat.
  

Stay tuned!
