## Abstract
The aim of this project to collect and document information about Zeblaze Thor Ultra 4G smartwatch. Getting `adb` access, backing up the ROM, maybe even custom ROMs or custom apps.

## Initial findings
- SoC used is [Unisoc 8541E](https://www.unisoc.com/en_us/home/con545-8541E-1) (also known as Spreadtrum SC8541E)
- Provided charger cable includes data lines and connects via USB as Spreadtrum Phone `idVendor=1782, idProduct=4011, bcdDevice= 4.04` 
- Possible way to get `adb` [via XDA forums](https://xdaforums.com/t/generic-sl8541e-sc8541e-information-about-generic-chinese-smartwatches-with-the-spreadtrum-unisoc-soc.4654255/post-89358195) (have not tested yet myself)

Stay tuned!
